# CKOS (Computer Knowledge Enthusiast Operating System) - User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to CKOS! This system emulates a DOS-like command-line interface in your browser. CKOS allows you to navigate a virtual file system and interact with files using simple commands. This manual will guide you through the available commands and how to use them.

## Available Commands

### 1. `help`

The `help` command displays a list of all available commands in CKOS, along with a brief description of what each command does. Use this command to familiarize yourself with the system's capabilities.

**Usage:** Simply type `help` and press Enter.

### 2. `dir`

The `dir` command lists all files and directories in the current directory. It is helpful for checking the contents of your current location in the virtual file system.

**Usage:** Type `dir` and press Enter to display the contents of the current directory.

### 3. `cd`

The `cd` command is used to change the current directory. You can specify the name of the directory you want to move into. You can also move up one level in the directory structure by typing `cd ..`.

**Usage:** Type `cd [directory-name]` to change into a directory. To move up one level, use `cd ..`.

### 4. `read`

The `read` command allows you to view the content of markdown (`.md`) files. When executed, CKOS will display the file's content in a modal.

**Usage:** Type `read [filename.md]` to open and view the markdown file.

### 5. `view`

The `view` command lets you open and view image files (`.webp`) and video files (`.mp4`). The content will be displayed in a modal, allowing you to interact with images and videos directly within CKOS.
