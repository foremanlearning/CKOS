  ```

- **Notes**:  
  - The `dir` command calculates and displays the file sizes in human-readable formats (e.g., KB, MB).
  - Free space is dynamically calculated based on the total size of files in the virtual file system.

- **Usage**:  
  ```
  cd <directory>
  ```

  - Files are saved back to the virtual file system, and optionally to `localStorage`.

---

### `read`

Reads and displays markdown (`.md`) files in a floating modal window. The markdown is rendered as HTML for easy reading.

- **Usage**:  
  ```
  read <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:

  read manual.md
  ```

- **Notes**:

  view example.webp
  ```

- **Notes**:

### `browser`

- **Usage**:  
  ```
  browser <filename>
  ```

- **Example**:  
  ```
  browser index.html
  ```

- **Notes**:  
  - This command is useful for previewing how HTML files will render in a browser without leaving the command-line environment.

---

### `format`

Formats the `C:` drive. This command supports a full format, which takes 5 minutes, or a quick format with the `/q` switch, which takes 15 seconds. After formatting, the user is prompted to enter a new volume name. During the format process, user input is disabled.

- **Usage**:  
  ```
  format C: [/q]
  ```

- **Options**:
  - `/q`: Quick format (15 seconds).
  
- **Example**:
  - **Normal Format**:
    ```
    format C:
    ```
    - Simulates a full format taking 5 minutes.
  
  - **Quick Format**:
    ```
    format C: /q
    ```
    - Simulates a quick format taking 15 seconds.

- **Process**:
  - **Step 1**: During the format, input from the user is disabled.
  - **Step 2**: A progress bar and status updates simulate the formatting process (e.g., "Writing tables...", "Lining up dominos...").
  - **Step 3**: After the format is completed, you will be prompted to enter a new volume name.
  - **Step 4**: The system resets the file system and reloads from `filesystem.json`, clearing local storage.

---

## Notes

- **Version Tracking**: CKOS includes version tracking, which is stored in `settings.json`. You can view the current version using the `version` command.
- **Local Storage**: CKOS uses local storage to persist files. The `format` command clears local storage and resets the file system to its initial state.
- **Floating Modal Windows**: Many commands, such as `read`, `view`, `ckcode`, and `browser`, open content in floating modal windows for a dynamic and modern interaction experience.
